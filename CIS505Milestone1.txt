CIS 505 Milestone 1

Members: Jeehwan Cho, Jennifer Hui, and Saad Anwar
Schedule of work: 
 
-Design protocols and refine plan by 4/8; 
-Submit milestone 2, write skeletal code with basic functionalities (multiple clients join a server and chat, not considering robustness), set up code sharing/version control mechanism, and set up test environment by 4/15; 
-Leader election, robustness, unit test for robustness, and start writing documents by 4/21;
-Wrap up, and polish code and document by 4/31.
 
"Rough" division of labor:
Testing/documentation
	(i) Reasonable sized network of clients
	(ii) Simple case - starting chat program, adding clients, sending messages, graceful exits
	(iii) Crashes and ungraceful exits, dropped packets, message ordering changes (how?)
Robustness
	(i) Leader crashing
	(ii) Client crashing
	(iii) Message drops - how do we even test and recover from a ‘false negative’
	(iv) Unexpected inputs, buffer overflows and avoiding segfaults as much as possible
Overall architecture (Design, skeletal code with basic functionalities)
	(i) Data Structures
	(ii) Message formats
	(iii) Design constraints (how many clients, how long a message can be, etc)
	(iv) Election protocol
	(v) Keep alive messages to determine crashes
